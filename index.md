## Bio

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sjwu1235/sjwu1235.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## What I look like

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
